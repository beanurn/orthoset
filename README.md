#The definition of a high-confidence orthologue gene set from de novo RNA-seq assemblies without a reference genome

This is a step-by-step guide to the bioinformatics analyses that generated a high-confidence orthologue gene set and input for coalescence analyses in the following study:
NÃ¼rnberger, Lohse, Fijarczyk, Szymura and Blaxter. Para-allopatry in hybridising fire-bellied toads (Bombina bombina and B. variegata): inference from transcriptome-wide coalescence analyses. [bioRxiv manuscript](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/28/030056)

This repository is provided solely to document the analyses. The pipeline is highly customised and would need extensive modification in order to be applied to other datasets. At present, there are no plans to turn this pipeline into a software tool.
